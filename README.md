# UI Hierarchy

## Basic understanding of the project
- It shows the heirarchy of a company. CEO -> departments ->  Team -> Team Leader -> Team Member
- Using '+' and '-' sign we can see the heirarchy moving from top to bottom
- Under HR and Design department there is only one team.
- Whereas Engineering department has two teams - Frontend team and Backend Team
- When we click on the team member we would be able to see all the members of that team

## Functionality and actions
- We can add any member to any of the team
- If there are two team in one department they can be moved from a team to second one. Like under engineering a member from frontend can be moved to backend and vice versa.
- We can remove a team member by clicking delete icon under actions
- We can update the employee information using edit icon
Note - Add, delete and editing information of the employee will be made on the data and the changes will be persisited as everything is stored in local storage
- We can filter the employee on the basis of name, phone number and email

Note - I was unable to to implement the feature to add a new team as it was increasing the complexity.
